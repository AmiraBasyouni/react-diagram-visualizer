# Roadmap: react-diagram-visualizer

This file outlines the phases and tasks for building the `react-diagram-visualizer` tool.

---

## Phase 1: MVP

### Stage 1

:checkered_flag: Goal: Visualize component nodes and their hierarchy. Take a `schema.json` file generated by [`react-diagram-schema`](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-schema) as input and render a basic diagram using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/).

#### Core Features:

- [x] Load ReactFlow nodes and edges from a `schema.json`
- [x] Visualize component as a node
- [x] Display internally defined states and functions
- [x] Display externally defined props and context
- [x] Draw edges based on component hierarchy

stage 1 **completed** on July 12, 2025

### Stage 2

:checkered_flag: Goal: use [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) to automatically arrange nodes hierarchically.

#### Core Features:

- [x] refactor initial node, edge, and type setup logic into a separate file
- [x] add elkjs as a dependency for graph layout calculations
- [x] setup elkjs node and edge logic
- [x] apply CSS Module styling to nodes (e.g. node border, font styles, background colors) for clear visualization

stage 2 **completed** on July 15, 2025

### Stage 3

:checkered_flag: Goal: support the new multi-file schema structure (introduced in [`react-diagram-schema`](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-schema)@v0.2.0). Refactor [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/) and [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs)'s node and edge set up

- [x] update syntax for ReactFlow's node and edge creation
- [x] update syntax for elkjs's node and edge creation
- [x] enhance error handling for descendants with invalid file paths

:hourglass: **Timeline**  
stage 3 **completed** on July 20, 2025

### Stage 4

:checkered_flag: Goal: set up a test suite to validate core logic, integration between components, and performance

- [x] Add unit tests for schema to Flow nodes/edges transformation
- [x] Add integration tests for ComponentNode, ReactFlow, and LayoutProvider wiring
- [x] Add performance test for large schema rendering
- [x] Add smoke test to ensure app renders without crashing

:hourglass: **Timeline**  
stage 4 **completed** on August 1, 2025

## Phase 2: Early Validation

:checkered_flag: Goal: get the product in front of real users to see if users are able to utilize and benefit from it

**:satellite: Target Audience:**

- solo React developers
- React developer teams
- developers that need to maintain a large React code base

:mailbox_with_mail: User Feedback:

- [ ] share the product with 3-5 users by reaching out to devs and publicly via platforms like [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) to validate the docs' usability and the product's effectiveness (e.g. ease of setup, understanding complex codebases, navigating complex component hierarchies, diagram clarity).
- [ ] collect feedback via GitHub Issues/Discussions to identify pain points (e.g., diagram clarity, setup issues)
- [ ] encourage contributions via [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-visualizer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to address usability issues.
- [ ] continue developing the MVP to fix any accessibility/usability issues

:hourglass_flowing_sand: **Timeline**  
phase 2 **scheduled** for October 1, 2025

## Phase 3: Product-Market Fit

:checkered_flag: Goal: Identify and prioritize the most requested features based on real user feedback to better align the tool with developer workflows.

:mailbox_with_mail: User Feedback:

- [ ] propose features (e.g. TypeScript support, manual node editing) via GitHub Issues to assess public demand
- [ ] keep a tally to figure out what the most requested features are

:wrench: Developer Check List:

- [ ] gather diagram generation performance metrics (e.g. for 50+ components)(target runtime: <2s rendering, target memory usage: <500MB)
- [ ] implement the most requested feature based on user feedback

**:sparkles: Features Under Consideration:**

1. Manual Augmentation Features:
   - [ ] Add node clicking to view a component's file path
   - [ ] Allow manual editing of node metadata (e.g., add prop types, descriptions) to enhance documentation and debugging.
     - [ ] Enable editing of a component’s description
     - [ ] Save modified schema back to file (or prepare for export)

---

2. Integration Features:
   - [ ] Integrate `react-diagram-schema` as a dependency to generate schemas directly from React source code within the visualizer (you won't need to install both repos separately)
   - [ ] Save, export, and share diagrams
   - [ ] Allow importing schemas from multiple sources:
     - [ ] src/schema.json (default)
     - [ ] Local file system
     - [ ] API endpoints
     - [ ] Directly from react-diagram-schema

---

3. Theming Features:
   - [ ] Dark mode and theming support

---

4. Enterprise Features:
   - [ ] enable collapsing nodes (i.e. hiding branches, needed for scalable diagrams that have about 50+ components)
   - [ ] support node grouping by file path
   - [ ] support TypeScript (when integrated in react-diagram-schema)
   - [ ] integrate diagrams into VS Code

:hourglass_flowing_sand: **Timeline**  
phase 3 **scheduled** for November 1, 2025

### :repeat: Next.js Migration Prep

To ensure an easy migration from Parcel to Next.js in the future, we’re following these practices:

- [x] All components use **CSS Modules**
- [ ] `schema.json` will live in the `public/` directory
- [x] No **Parcel-specific features** used (e.g. no custom transformers or entry points)
- [x] App entry is designed to later move to `/src/app/page.js` (App Router structure)
