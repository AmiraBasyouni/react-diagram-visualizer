# Roadmap: react-diagram-visualizer

This file outlines the phases and tasks for building the `react-diagram-visualizer` tool.

---

## Phase 1: MVP

### Stage 1

🏁 Goal: Visualize component nodes and their hierarchy. Take a `schema.json` file generated by [`react-diagram-schema`](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-schema) as input and render a basic diagram using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/).

#### Core Features:

- [x] Load ReactFlow nodes and edges from a `schema.json`
- [x] Visualize component as a node
- [x] Display internally defined states and functions
- [x] Display externally defined props and context
- [x] Draw edges based on component hierarchy

⌛ Timeline: **completed** July 12, 2025

### Stage 2

🏁 Goal: use [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) to automatically arrange nodes hierarchically.

#### Core Features:

- [x] refactor initial node, edge, and type setup logic into a separate file
- [x] add elkjs as a dependency for graph layout calculations
- [x] setup elkjs node and edge logic
- [x] apply CSS Module styling to nodes (e.g. node border, font styles, background colors) for clear visualization

⌛ Timeline: **completed** July 15, 2025

### Stage 3

🏁 Goal: support the new multi-file schema structure (introduced in [`react-diagram-schema`](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-schema)@v0.2.0). Refactor [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/) and [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs)'s node and edge set up

- [x] update syntax for ReactFlow's node and edge creation
- [x] update syntax for elkjs's node and edge creation
- [x] enhance error handling for descendants with invalid file paths

⌛ Timeline: **completed** July 20, 2025

## Phase 2: Early Validation

🏁 Goal: get the product in front of real users to see if users are able to utilize and benefit from it

**🔈 Target Audience:**

- solo React developers
- React developer teams
- developers that need to maintain a large React code base

**🔍 Developer Check List:**

- [ ] share the product with 3-5 users by reaching out to devs and publicly via platforms like [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) to validate the docs' usability and the product's effectiveness (e.g. ease of setup, understanding complex codebases, navigating complex component hierarchies, diagram clarity).
- [ ] collect feedback via GitHub Issues/Discussions to identify pain points (e.g., diagram clarity, setup issues)
- [ ] encourage contributions via [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/AmiraBasyouni/react-diagram-visualizer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to address usability issues.
- [ ] continue developing the MVP to fix any accessibility/usability issues

⏳ Timeline **scheduled** - July 31, 2025

## Phase 3: Product-Market Fit

🏁 Goal: Identify and prioritize the most requested features based on real user feedback to better align the tool with developer workflows.

**🔍 Developer Check List:**

- [ ] propose features (e.g. TypeScript support, manual node editing) via GitHub Issues to assess public demand
- [ ] keep a tally to figure out what the most requested features are

**🔧 Developer Check List:**

- [ ] gather diagram generation performance metrics (e.g. for 50+ components)(target runtime: <2s rendering, target memory usage: <500MB)
- [ ] implement the most requested feature based on user feedback

**✨ Features Under Consideration:**

✦ Manual Augmentation Features:

- [ ] Add node clicking to view a component's file path
- [ ] Allow manual editing of node metadata (e.g., add prop types, descriptions) to enhance documentation and debugging.
  - [ ] Enable editing of a component’s description
  - [ ] Save modified schema back to file (or prepare for export)

✦ Integration Features:

- [ ] Integrate `react-diagram-schema` as a dependency to generate schemas directly from React source code within the visualizer (you won't need to install both repos separately)
- [ ] Save, export, and share diagrams
- [ ] Allow importing schemas from multiple sources:
  - [ ] src/schema.json (default)
  - [ ] Local file system
  - [ ] API endpoints
  - [ ] Directly from react-diagram-schema

✦ Theming Features:

- [ ] Dark mode and theming support

✦ Enterprise Features:

- [ ] enable collapsing nodes (i.e. hiding branches, needed for scalable diagrams that have about 50+ components)
- [ ] support node grouping by file path
- [ ] support TypeScript (when integrated in react-diagram-schema)
- [ ] integrate diagrams into VS Code

⏳ **scheduled** - August 10, 2025

### 🔁 Next.js Migration Prep

To ensure an easy migration from Parcel to Next.js in the future, we’re following these practices:

- [x] All components use **CSS Modules**
- [ ] `schema.json` will live in the `public/` directory
- [x] No **Parcel-specific features** used (e.g. no custom transformers or entry points)
- [x] App entry is designed to later move to `/src/app/page.js` (App Router structure)
